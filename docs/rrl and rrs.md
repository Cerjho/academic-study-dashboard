1. Lived Experiences and Challenges of Irregular Students
Irregular students—often referred to as "shifters" or "transferees"—face unique logistical and social hurdles. A phenomenological study on irregular students in Philippine private institutions reveals that their primary challenges include "conflicting class schedules," "social isolation," and the difficulty of navigating multiple peer groups. Unlike regular students who have a built-in support system (the block), irregular students must constantly adapt to new classmates, which can lead to anxiety and a feeling of being "left behind." This fragmentation of their social and academic life is a critical factor that threatens their academic consistency.

2.Irregular Attendance of University Students at Class and Its Relation to Their Academic Achievement

Journal: Tribhuvan University Journal (TUJ) — ISSN: 2091-0916
Vol/Issue/Date/Pages: Vol. 33, No. 1, June 2019 — pp. 115–128.
Author & affiliation: Shanti Prasad Khanal — Lecturer, Surkhet Campus (Education), Tribhuvan University.
Structure & methods (implied): descriptive mixed methods: survey of students (n=172) + qualitative inputs from administrators/teachers; statistical tests (chi-square) used.
Key findings (relevant points you can use): reported that irregular attendance is common and that there is a positive, statistically significant relationship between class attendance and academic achievement — students with more regular attendance performed better on average; institutional and student factors (work, university scheduling, socio-economic) contributed to irregularity. The paper recommends integrated institutional measures to address absenteeism.

3. Challenges Faced by Irregular Students and Their Academic Performance
The study titled “Challenges Faced by Irregular Students,” published in the International Journal of Research Publication and Reviews (IJRPR), investigated the academic challenges encountered by irregular students in higher education. Using a descriptive qualitative approach, the study found that irregular students commonly experience schedule conflicts, limited academic support, reduced peer interaction, and increased stress, which negatively affect their academic performance. These challenges often result in lower academic achievement, decreased class participation, and difficulty maintaining motivation. The study concluded that irregular enrollment status contributes to academic instability and emphasized the importance of institutional support mechanisms to improve the academic outcomes of irregular students. This literature is relevant to the present study as it supports the premise that enrollment status significantly influences academic achievement among college students.

RELATED STUDIES
1 .Investigating the relationship between school attendance and academic performance in universal primary education: The case of Uganda
in their study on the relationship between irregular class attendance and students’ academic performance, employed a quantitative research design to compare regularly and irregularly attending students and found that irregular attendance significantly lowered academic achievement by disrupting learning continuity, reducing classroom participation and instructor interaction, limiting mastery of subject content, and ultimately resulting in poorer academic outcomes, which directly supports the present study on the impact of enrollment status on academic achievement among Computer Science students at Mabini College.

2. Case Study on the Irregularity of Students in School
This case study compared regular and irregular students in terms of academic behavior and performance, revealing that irregular students generally face more academic challenges due to attendance issues and reduced engagement in class activities. The study supports the idea that irregular enrollment status is associated with lower academic achievement when compared to regular students.

3.Irregular Students: Their Academic and Employment Struggles

This research investigated the academic struggles of irregular college students and found that balancing academics with work responsibilities often leads to lower academic performance. The study highlights that irregular enrollment status can intensify academic difficulties due to time constraints and divided focus, which directly impacts students’ academic achievement.
