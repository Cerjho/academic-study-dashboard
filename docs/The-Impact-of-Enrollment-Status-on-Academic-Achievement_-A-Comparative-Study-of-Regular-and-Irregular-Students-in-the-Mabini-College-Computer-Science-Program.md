RELATED LITERATURE
Lived Experiences and Challenges of Irregular Students
Irregular students, commonly referred to as shifters or transferees, encounter distinct academic and social challenges compared to regular students. A phenomenological study conducted in private higher education institutions in the Philippines explored the lived experiences of irregular students and revealed that they frequently struggle with conflicting class schedules, social isolation, and difficulties in forming stable peer relationships (Author(s), Year). Unlike regular students who benefit from block sectioning and consistent peer support, irregular students must continuously adjust to new classmates and learning environments. This situation often results in feelings of anxiety, academic disconnection, and the perception of being left behind academically. The fragmentation of both social and academic experiences was identified as a significant factor that threatens academic consistency and persistence among irregular students.
Irregular Attendance and Academic Achievement
Attendance plays a crucial role in students’ academic success. Khanal (2019) examined irregular class attendance among university students and its relationship to academic achievement using a descriptive mixed-methods approach. The study found that irregular attendance was prevalent and that there was a positive and statistically significant relationship between regular class attendance and higher academic performance. Students who attended classes more consistently achieved better academic outcomes compared to those with frequent absences. The study also identified institutional, socioeconomic, and personal factors—such as employment responsibilities and scheduling conflicts—as major contributors to irregular attendance. The findings highlight the need for coordinated institutional strategies to reduce absenteeism and support students at risk of poor academic performance.
Academic Challenges of Irregular Students
Another study published in the International Journal of Research Publication and Reviews investigated the academic challenges faced by irregular students in higher education. Using a descriptive qualitative research design, the study revealed that irregular students commonly experience schedule conflicts, limited access to academic support, reduced peer interaction, and increased stress levels (Author(s), Year). These challenges were found to negatively affect students’ academic performance, class participation, and motivation. The study concluded that irregular enrollment status contributes to academic instability and emphasized the importance of institutional support mechanisms to improve the academic outcomes of irregular students. This literature supports the premise that enrollment status is a significant factor influencing academic achievement in higher education.
RELATED STUDIES
School Attendance and Academic Performance
A quantitative study conducted in Uganda investigated the relationship between school attendance and academic performance under the Universal Primary Education program. The researchers compared the academic outcomes of regularly attending students and those with irregular attendance patterns. The findings showed that irregular attendance significantly lowered academic achievement by disrupting learning continuity, reducing classroom participation and teacher–student interaction, and limiting mastery of subject content (Author(s), Year). These results directly support the present study, as they demonstrate that inconsistent attendance negatively affects academic performance. The study reinforces the assumption that enrollment status and attendance patterns play a critical role in determining students’ academic achievement, particularly among Computer Science students at Mabini College.

Data Analysis Results and Discussion
Profile of the Respondents
The study gathered data from a total of 73 respondents enrolled in the Computer Science program at Mabini College during the Academic Year 2024–2025. Of these respondents, 55 students (75.34%) were classified as regular students, while 18 students (24.66%) were classified as irregular students based on their enrollment status.
The relatively higher proportion of regular students reflects the standard academic progression within the program. Nonetheless, the presence of a substantial group of irregular students provides a sufficient basis for conducting a comparative analysis of academic performance across enrollment classifications.
Distribution of Academic Performance (GWA)
Academic achievement was measured using students’ General Weighted Average (GWA) and grouped into standard academic performance brackets to facilitate meaningful comparison.


Academic Performance of Regular Students
Among regular students, the distribution of GWA shows a generally strong academic standing:
12 students (21.82%) attained a GWA within the 1.0–1.49 range, indicating excellent academic performance.
20 students (36.36%) recorded a GWA of 1.5–1.99, reflecting above-average academic achievement.
22 students (40.00%) fell within the 2.0–2.49 range, which remains within satisfactory academic performance.
Only 1 student (1.82%) recorded a GWA of 2.5–2.99, representing the lowest performance bracket among regular students.



Overall, the majority of regular students (approximately 98%) achieved a GWA below 2.5, suggesting relatively consistent academic success within this group.




Academic Performance of Irregular Students
In contrast, the academic performance distribution of irregular students demonstrates a markedly different pattern:
No irregular students recorded a GWA within the 1.0–1.49 range.
3 students (16.67%) achieved a GWA of 1.5–1.99.
3 students (16.67%) fell within the 2.0–2.49 range.
A substantial majority of 12 students (66.66%) recorded a GWA of 2.5–2.99, indicating lower academic performance relative to their regular counterparts.



This distribution shows that more than two-thirds of irregular students are concentrated in the lowest academic performance bracket, highlighting potential academic challenges associated with irregular enrollment status.
Study Habits
Study duration differed notably between the two groups. Irregular students most commonly reported studying 1–2 hours per day (44.44% or 8 students), followed by 3–4 hours (33.33% or 6 students), while very few (5.56% or 1 student) reported studying for more than four hours daily.
Conversely, regular students demonstrated more intensive study routines, with 38.89% (21 students) studying more than four hours per day, suggesting greater time investment in academic activities among regular enrollees. 


Attendance, Time Management, and Academic Engagement
In terms of attendance, regular students reported higher consistency, with a greater proportion indicating they always attend classes, whereas irregular students more frequently selected often or sometimes.
Similarly, self-assessments of time management showed that regular students were more likely to rate their skills as good, while irregular students predominantly reported fair time management abilities.
Patterns of academic engagement further revealed that regular students were more consistent in assignment submission and class participation, with higher frequencies in the always and often categories compared to irregular students.

Workload Management
Difficulty in balancing academic workload was reported more frequently by irregular students, with 66.67%, 12 out of 18 irregular students, indicating they experienced such challenges. In comparison, only 25.93% or 5 students of regular students reported similar difficulties, while 40.74% indicated no difficulty managing their workload. These findings suggest that irregular students face greater challenges in workload management. 

Perceptions of Enrollment Status
A strong majority of respondents believed that enrollment status influences academic performance. This perception was more pronounced among irregular students, with 83.33%, 15 out of 18, responding affirmatively, compared to 64.81%, 36 out of 55, of regular students. This indicates a heightened awareness among irregular students of the potential academic implications of their enrollment classification.





Factors Influencing Academic Performance
Across all respondents, 51 students identified lack of study time as a major factor affecting academic performance. This was followed by heavy class load (29 students), motivation level (25 students), attendance issues (21 students), personal or family concerns (19 students), and financial concerns (17 students).
When examined by enrollment status, 17 irregular students identified lack of study time, 8 students cited personal or family concerns, and 8 students reported heavy class load as key factors. Among regular students, 34 students identified lack of study time, 21 students cited heavy class load, 21 students reported motivation level, 19 students identified attendance issues, and 17 students cited financial concerns. 




Discussion
The findings reveal a notable contrast between academic performance and study behaviors across enrollment types. Despite reporting fewer study hours and greater difficulty in managing workload, irregular students demonstrated higher average academic performance, as reflected in their GWA distribution. This suggests that the flexibility associated with irregular enrollment may allow students to concentrate more effectively on selected academic requirements, thereby enhancing performance outcomes for certain individuals.
Conversely, regular students, while exhibiting stronger attendance, time management, and engagement, may be constrained by structural and external pressures, such as financial obligations and attendance requirements, which may affect overall academic outcomes.
Taken together, the results support the conclusion that enrollment status plays a significant role in shaping students’ academic experiences and performance, with irregular students perceiving a more direct impact on their academic success.
